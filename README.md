# Unit Test Generator for C++ using LLMs – Final Report

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an AI-powered tool that automatically generates and refines unit tests for a C++ application. The system uses a local LLM (Ollama) to produce test cases using prompt engineering via YAML-based instructions.

## 🔍 Approach

- **Initial Test Generation**  
  The input C++ source file is sent to the LLM with the `generate_tests.yaml` prompt. The resulting tests are saved as `tests/test_main_generated.cpp`.

- **Refinement**  
  The generated tests are improved using the `refine_tests.yaml` prompt, and the final refined version is saved as `tests/test_main_refined.cpp`.

- **Build System**  
  - Used `g++` with flags `-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage` to enable code coverage tracking.
  - Coverage data captured using `gcov` and `lcov`.
  - HTML report generated using `genhtml`.

- **Error Handling**  
  If a compilation or test failure occurs, build logs are analyzed and sent back to the LLM to automatically refine the tests.
